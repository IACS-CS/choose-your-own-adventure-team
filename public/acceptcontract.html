<h2> Accept Contract</h2>
<h3>Im ready</h3>
<p> <p>It's been <strong>ten years</strong> since I first set my sights on boxing. 
When I was <strong>12</strong>, I told my dad, “I want to become a professional 
boxer and a champion one day.” Fast forward <strong>five years</strong>, 
and my days were filled with early mornings and 
relentless training. I'd wake up at <strong>7 a.m.</strong>, focused 
solely on boxing. By <strong>8</strong>, I was at the gym, ready for 
my rigorous routine: <em>stretching</em>, <em>jump rope</em>, <em>jumping jacks</em>, 
<em>shadow boxing</em>, <em>heavy bag work</em>, <em>head movement drills</em>, 
<em>pad work with Dad</em>, and finally, <em>speed bag</em>, <em>abs</em>, and <em>cardio</em>. 
This was my daily grind for <strong>five years</strong>, shaping my 
impressive amateur record of <strong>115 wins</strong> and only <strong>2 losses</strong>. 
Yet, the <strong>real challenge</strong> lay ahead.
At <strong>22</strong>, I was offered my first professional contract. 
The excitement was palpable, but so were the <em>doubts</em>. 
My opponent was <strong>undefeated at 5-0</strong>, and I wondered if I was 
truly ready. Many of my peers went pro at <strong>18</strong> and became 
champions by <strong>25</strong>. I aimed to achieve that same feat.
When the contract came, I knew it was <strong>my moment</strong>. 
Despite the doubts, I accepted the offer, ready to embrace 
the challenge. I felt prepared to make my mark in the boxing 
world and prove myself on this grand stage. With unwavering 
determination, I was set to turn my dream into reality and 
take on the new chapter of my boxing journey.</p>
