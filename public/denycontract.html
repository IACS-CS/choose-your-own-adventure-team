   <h1>Deny Contract</h1>
   <h2>This is the beginning.</h2>
   <h3>Am I ready?</h3>
  <p> I've been boxing for 10 years, but I don't think 
I am ready to go pro. </p> 
<p>It's been <strong>ten years</strong> since I first set my sights on boxing. 
When I was <strong>12</strong>, I told my dad, “I want to become a <strong>professional boxer</strong> 
and a <strong>champion</strong> one day.” Fast forward <strong>five years</strong>, 
and my days were filled with early mornings and relentless training. I'd wake up at <strong>7 a.m.</strong>, 
focused solely on boxing. By <strong>8</strong>, I was at the gym, ready for my rigorous routine:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>stretching</em></li>
<li><em>jump rope</em></li>
<li><em>jumping jacks</em></li>
<li><em>shadow boxing</em></li>
<li><em>heavy bag work</em></li>
<li><em>head movement drills</em></li>
<li><em>pad work with Dad</em></li>
<li><em>speed bag</em></li>
<li><em>abs</em></li>
<li><em>cardio</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This was my daily grind for <strong>five years</strong>, shaping my impressive amateur record 
of <strong>115 wins</strong> and only <strong>2 losses</strong>. Yet, the <strong>real challenge</strong> lay ahead.</p>
<p>At <strong>22</strong>, I was offered my first professional contract. The excitement was there, 
but so were the <em>doubts</em>. My opponent was <strong>undefeated at 5-0</strong>, 
and I wondered if I was truly ready. Many of my peers went pro at <strong>18</strong> and became champions by <strong>25</strong>. 
I aimed to achieve that same feat.</p>
<p>But when the contract came, I knew it wasn't the right time for me. I <strong>denied</strong>, 
choosing instead to dedicate the next year to <strong>unparalleled training</strong>. I was determined to refine my skills, 
and next year, I would seize that contract and make my mark in the boxing world.</p></p>
