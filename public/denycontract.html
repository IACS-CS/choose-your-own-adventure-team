   <h1>Deny Contract</h1>
   <p>This is the beginning.</p>
  <p> I've been boxing for 10 years, but I don't think 
I am ready to go pro. </p> 
  <p>It's been ten years since I first set my sights on boxing.
When I was 12, I told my dad, “I want to become a professional boxer and a champion one day.” 
Fast forward five years, and my days were filled with early mornings and relentless training.
I'd wake up at 7 a.m., focused solely on boxing. By 8, I was at the gym, ready for my rigorous routine: 
stretching, jump rope, jumping jacks, shadow boxing, heavy bag work, head movement drills, pad work with Dad,
and finally, speed bag, abs, and cardio. This was my daily grind for five years, shaping my impressive amateur
record of 115 wins and only 2 losses. Yet, the real challenge lay ahead.  
At 22, I was offered my first professional contract. The excitement was there, but so were the doubts. 
My opponent was undefeated at 5-0, and I wondered if I was truly ready. Many of my peers went pro at 18 and became champions by 25. 
I aimed to achieve that same feat.
But when the contract came, I knew it wasn't the right time for me. 
I declined, choosing instead to dedicate the next year to unparalleled training. I was determined to refine my skills, and next year, 
I would seize that contract and make my mark in the boxing world.</p>
