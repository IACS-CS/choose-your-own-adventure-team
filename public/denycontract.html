   <h1>Deny Contract</h1>
   <h2>This is the beginning.</h2>
   <h3>Am I ready?</h3>
  <p> I've been boxing for 10 years, but I don't think 
I am ready to go pro. </p> 
<p>It's been <strong>ten years</strong> since I first set my sights on boxing. 
When I was <strong>12</strong>, I told my dad, “I want to become a <strong>professional boxer</strong> 
and a <strong>champion</strong> one day.” Fast forward <strong>five years</strong>; my days were filled with early mornings and constant training. I'd wake up at <strong>7 a.m.</strong>, 
focused mainly on boxing. By <strong>8:30</strong>, I was at the gym, ready for my long workout routine</p>
<ul>
<ol>Stretching</ol>
<ol>jump rope</ol>
<ol>jumping jacks</ol>
<ol>shawdow boxing</ol>
<ol>heavy bag work</ol>
<ol>head movement drills</ol>
<ol>pad work with dad</ol>
<ol>speed bag</ol>
<ol>abs</ol> 
<ol>cardio</ol>
</ul>
<p>This was my daily grind for <strong>five years</strong>, shaping my impressive amateur record 
of <strong>116 wins</strong> and only <strong>2 losses</strong>. But now, the <strong>real challenge</strong> lay ahead.</p>
<p>At <strong>20</strong>, I was offered my first professional contract. The excitement was there, 
but so were the <em>doubts</em>. My opponent was <strong>undefeated at 5-0</strong>, 
and I wondered if I was truly ready. Many of my boxing friends went pro at <strong>18</strong> and became champions by <strong>25</strong>. 
I aimed to achieve that same feat.</p>
<p>But when the contract came, I knew it wasn't the right time for me. I <strong>denied</strong>, 
choosing instead to dedicate the next year to <strong>unparalleled training</strong>. I was determined to refine my skills, 
and next year, I would seize that contract and make my mark in the boxing world.</p></p>
